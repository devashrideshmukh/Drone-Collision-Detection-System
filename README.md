Drone Collision Detection System - Synopsis

This project is an application of Machine learning algorithms in problem of Drone Collision Detection. In order to improve performance and travelling efficiency of a drone in air there is a growing emphasis on detection of anomalies in air. This system identifies anomalies and detects the best path for the drone to travel to its destination with high computational efficiency. It also helps the drone travel by a previously trained path in order to save computations of detection of path at every instance. As the drone, travels from source to its destination, its path is stored (learned) in the Machine Dataset. The path travelled the most indicates that it is the path with lower anomalies, and is the best path for travel. Hence, it is chosen as the path to travel by the drone. If anomalies occur in this path, while the travel, the next best path is chosen from the machine’s learned data set.
